4x4 Tic Tac Toe final project for Artificial Intelligence (CS4613)

The game is played between a human and a computer. The computer has two different settings that can be modified to change the difficulty.
Cutoff Time - the max amount of compute time allowed to calculate a move
Cutoff Depth - the maximum depth the search tree can go before determining a move

Easy:
  - time cutoff: 10000 ms (will never reach at this depth)
  - depth cutoff: 1
Medium:

  - time cutoff: 10000 ms (will never reach at this depth)
  - depth cutoff: 2
Hard:
  - time cutoff: 10000 ms
  - depth cutoff: 0 (there is no cutoff)
